<h2> Description </h2>

<p> This dish was created in the Lazio region in the middle of the 20th century, after World War Two. We don't use cream, milk, garlic, onions or other strange ingredients; we use only guanciale, eggs, pecorino cheese, and lots of black pepper. </p>

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul> 
  <li> 2 teaspoons olive oil </li>
  <li> 1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced </li>
  <li> 1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti </li>
  <li> 3 eggs </li>
  <li> 10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided </li>
  <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>

</ul>

<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
 <li> Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.
</li>
 
 <li> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
 
 <li> Whisk eggs, half of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale. Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper. </li>
 </ol>
